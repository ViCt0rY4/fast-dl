Turned into zm_storm by Boban

Notes: Lights are adjusted for "a" light. There are many weapons, grenades and kevlar vests laying around on boxes, try to find them. Rooves are blocked in original de_storm but now they are not (upper rooves are still blocked). There is also a special event that happens 2 minutes after round start.
